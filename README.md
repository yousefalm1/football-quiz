## Features

### The Home Page 


* The Home Page welcomes users and gives them access to key options as the quiz application's entry point.

* The entire content of the home page is enclosed in a white box that will remain constant throughout the quiz. The background of the home page is a football pitch to match the quiz's theme, and there is a football logo at the top left of the page that can be clicked to return the user to the home page.

* The "Welcome To The Football Quiz!" huge, attention-grabbing title greets users, followed by a brief sentence encouraging them to begin the quiz.

* Below the brief sentence, there are two light green buttons stacked one on top of the other with a hover effect that changes the colour to dark green as the mouse is moved over them. The "Pick Game Mode" button takes the user to a page where they can choose between two game modes, easy and hard. The "How To Play" button, which is the second, takes the user to a page that describes how the game functions.
